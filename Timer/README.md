# Timer

A simple **console-based stopwatch & countdown timer** written in C. This project demonstrates how to build a small C application using CMake, and how to generate both a native Linux executable (`timer`) and a Windows-style executable (`timer.exe`) along with a helper shell script (`run_timer.sh`)


## üéØ Features

- **Stopwatch** 
  - Start/stop by pressing Enter 
  - Displays elapsed time in seconds with two-decimal precision 

- **Countdown Timer** 
  - Enter a number of seconds (integer) 
  - Shows remaining time in `MM:SS` format, updated every second 
  - Alerts ‚ÄúTime‚Äôs up!‚Äù with a bell character (`\a`) when finished
